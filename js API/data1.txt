Backman got his inspiration for this book after reading an article about a man named Ove who had a fit while buying tickets at an art museum.
 Backman instantly related to this man as he claims to be "not great at talking to people".
  He started writing blogposts under the heading, "I am a Man Called Ove", 
  where he wrote about his pet peeves and annoyances. Eventually, 
  he realized that his writing had potential for the creation of an interesting fictional character.
